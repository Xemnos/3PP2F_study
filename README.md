# 3PP2F
The objective of this work is to study a 3PP2F robotic structure. 

This structure is a parallel continuum robot composed of kinematic chain. Each chain presents two prismatic joints (actuation system) and 2 flexible elements.

The objective of the robotâ€™s model is to simulate the workspace, the stiffness and at the end control the robot using SOFA. It can be interesting to use it also to simulate and identify better or worst mechanical structure of this robotic structure. Indeed, simulations could be useful to identify singularities (robotic and mechanical ones) .
